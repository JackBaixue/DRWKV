<blockquote>
<b>Abstract:</b> <i>Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging
task, particularly in preserving object edge continuity and fine
structural details under extreme illumination degradation. In this
paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance
Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of
illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity.
Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-
scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and
models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design
the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS¬≤-Loss
to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving
visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments
on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves
leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while main-
taining low computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV
enhances downstream performance in low-light multi-object
tracking tasks, validating its generalization capabilities.</i>
